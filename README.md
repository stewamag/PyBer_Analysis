# PyBer Analysis

Analysis of all Pyber ride-share data from January to early May of 2019. The purpose of the analysis was to create visualizations of ride-share data for PyBer in order to improve access to ride-sharing, understand rates, and ensure that ride-sharing was affordable regardless of the type of community in which it occurred.

## Overview of the analysis:

Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib were employed to create an analysis of the ride-share data using series, dataframes, and charts.

The following were determined:
	- Total Rides
	- Total Drivers
	- Total Fares
	- Average Fare per Ride
	- Average Fare per Driver
	- Total Weekly Fares for Each City Type

## Results:

It was determined that although urban city types were the bulk of the ride count and fare revenue, the fare per ride and fare per driver were actually the lowest in these cities. The highest fares were in the rural cities where there were fewer available drivers and rides in general. Affordability for ride-share is at its best in urban cities. 

	- Total Rides
		* Urban: 1,625 rides
		* Suburban: 625 rides
		* Rural: 125 rides
	- Total Drivers
		* Urban: 2,405 drivers
		* Suburban: 490 drivers
		* Rural: 78 drivers
	- Total Fares
		* Urban: $39,854.38 in fares
		* Suburban: $19,356.33 in fares
		* Rural: $4,327.93 in fares
	- Average Fare per Ride
		* Urban: $24.53 per ride
		* Suburban: $30.97 per ride
		* Rural: $34.62 per ride
	- Average Fare per Driver
		* Urban: $16.57 per driver
		* Suburban: $39.50 per driver
		* Rural: $55.49 per driver

## Summary:

Business recommendations related to the data analysis findings:

1. Make ride-share more accessible in suburban and rural neighborhoods. Work on recruiting more drivers to increase availability and access to ride-sharing services.

2. Create a 'pool' option for ride-sharing to decrease the cost, especially in rural neighborhoods. Allow drivers to pick up multiple riders with multiple drop-off points along a similar route. This will decrease the cost per ride for the rider, making it more accessible for the general public. It will also increase the revenue for the driver and the company at large.

3. Introduce surge-pricing in urban cities. The cost per ride is the lowest there. Late at night or at times where events or activities are happening in the city, increase the price of the ride. Customers will still need the ride and will pay a little bit extra in that situation to get home safely.
